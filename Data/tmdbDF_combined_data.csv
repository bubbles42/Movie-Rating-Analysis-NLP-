Based upon his critically acclaimed stage show, Wake Up and Smell the Coffee is Bogosian at his funniest, smartest, and angriest. Taking us for a ferocious ride through a cavalcade of colorful characters in his mind, Bogosian skewers pop culture, conformity, religious hypocrisy and human nature itself with a razor-sharp wit. Whether he’s playing Satan as a modern-day salesman, a Hollywood producer capitalizing on an airplane disaster, a spiritual guru with questionable motives, or mocking himself as an obsequious actor auditioning for a part, Bogosian tackles today’s relevant, post-9/11 themes with uncompromising honesty.",1.165,/quj8dAS4ntVhj7pS9OcS0lZFEAU.jpg,[],"[{'iso_3166_1': 'US', 'name': 'United States of America'}]",2001-01-01,0.0,77.0,"[{'english_name': 'English', 'iso_639_1': 'en', 'name': 'English'}]",Released,,Eric Bogosian: Wake Up and Smell the Coffee,0.0,0.0,0.0,

From the little that is known of the ill-fated nun's life, Italy-based American writer-director Roger Deutsch has made the boldly speculative yet persuasive Italian-language film ""Suor Sorriso"" in which the nun (Ginevra Colonna) emerges as a tormented, unstable woman who abruptly left the convent after her recording triumph before taking her final vows. Running a shelter for wayward girls, she and another ex-nun (Simona Caparrini) enter a passionate, tumultuous and destructive affair. Colonna's volcanic Deckers craves spiritual redemption as well as the other woman's love but is so beset by demons that she embarks on a flamboyant, drug-fueled downward spiral that ultimately engulfs her lover as well as herself.",0.714,/mYTeqMulycag2w83j36N41UzRnc.jpg,[],"[{'iso_3166_1': 'IT', 'name': 'Italy'}]",2001-02-12,0.0,98.0,"[{'english_name': 'Italian', 'iso_639_1': 'it', 'name': 'Italiano'}]",Released,,Sister Smile,0.0,0.8,2.0,

At the same time, scenes from the first part of the movie bring unexpected facts when seen the second or the third time.
